Expanding on a 1908 paper by Smoluchowski, he derived a formula for the intensity of scattered light in media fluctuating densities that reduces to Rayleigh's law for ideal gases in The Theory of the Opalescence of Homogenous Fluids and Liquid Mixtures near the Critical State. That research supported his theories of matter first developed when he calculated the diffusion constant in terms of fundamental parameters of the particles of a gas undergoing Brownian Motion. In that same year, 1905, he also published On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light. That explication of the photoelectric effect won him 1921 Nobel in Physics. For ten points, name this German physicist best known for his theory of Relativity.
